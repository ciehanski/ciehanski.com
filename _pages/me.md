subtitle: Congrats, you found me! I’ve been tinkering with computers since I was 10 years old and I built my first computer a year later at 11 (thank you Dad). The rest is history. I am always challenging myself, learning, or adding something new to my toolbox. My primary areas of interest include <mark>programming</mark>, <mark>networking</mark>, and <mark>distributed systems</mark>.
