     A CLI tool used to access the Library Genesis dataset; written in Go. I built this tool when I discovered the [Library Gensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis) project. I'm a firm believer in the ideals behind the project, but the websites used to acces their dataset are difficult to navigate and download pages are riddled with adware. So, to mitigate this poor user expierence, I created libgen-cli (originally forked from [Antoine Chiny](https://github.com/TonyChG/libgen-cli))! Currently <mark>libgen-cli</mark> is being used in various countries around the world, which I think is cool.
